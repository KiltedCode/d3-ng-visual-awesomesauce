# d3-ng-visual-awesomesauce

Code for the talk _D3 + Angular == Visual Awesomesauce_. Current version as presented at [AngularMix](https://angularmix.com/) in Orlando, FL on October 11, 2017.

## Abstract

A picture is worth 1000 words, but a data visualization is worth 1000 table rows. 

In a world and internet full of data you need to give users value from the numbers. With the combination of D3 and Angular, we can take that data and create versatile and interactive visualizations that respond to dynamic data.
